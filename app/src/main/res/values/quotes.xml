        <item>Good to forgive, the best to forget.</item>
        <item>Greed is an imperfection that defiles the mind; hate is an imperfection that defiles the mind; delusion is an imperfection that defiles the mind.</item>
        <item>Happiness comes when your work and words are of benefit to yourself and others.</item>
        <item>Happiness is a journey not a destination.</item>

        <item>If while on your way you meet no one your equal or better, steadily continue on your way alone. There is no fellowship with fools.</item>
        <item>If you do not change direction, you may end up where you are heading.</item>
        <item>If you find no one to support you on the spiritual path, walk alone. There is no companionship with the immature.</item>
        <item>If you light a lamp for somebody, it will also brighten your path.</item>

        <item>Ignorance is the real evil.</item>
        <item>In a controversy the instant we feel anger we have already ceased striving for the truth, and have begun striving for ourselves.</item>
        <item>In every trial let understanding fight for you.</item>
        <item>In separateness lies the world\'s greatest misery; in compassion lies the world\'s
            true strength.</item>
